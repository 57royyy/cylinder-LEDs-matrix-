About the mechanical part, we divided in 3 main parts of work:

•	Create the global structure

•	Create the pixels form to put the lights inside each 

•	And how to blur the light to have a uniform pixel for the light.



We work on a quarter of circle but when the quarter is usable, we will juST print it 3 more and assemble it.



The structure is divided 2 parts:

•	In vertical part, straight with 11 pixels on

•	The horizontal, circular ones, subdivided on 2 others:

 -> The inside ones, which are thin circle. There are 10 of them to define the pixels.

 -> And the exterior one, which have 19 pixels which are full to maintain and for other technical constraints which will appear later.

The internal is composed of straight rod to fix the pixels on it and make the assemblage easier to manage with the cable which connect the different columns of pixels.

This way, we have a global structure with square pixel of 3cm of side, which all have a functional pixel on the center.

Now, we want to blur it, which means we want to diffuse the light on all the pixels. To do this, we use a flexible and opaque plastic. We dimension it and create little hole on the external parts to clip it and this way it won’t move.
